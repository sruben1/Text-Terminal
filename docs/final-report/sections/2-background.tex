ncursesw version 6 \cite{ncursesw} is the library that we chose to build our text-based UI because it has good terminal support. Specifically we chose the wide characters version of ncruses so that it can support Unicode and international character sets (standard ncurses only has ASCII support).
\\\\We also used xclip \cite{xclip} for our copy/paste functionality. It allows accessing the clipborad in X11, which is the Linux desktop environment. It bridges the terminal and GUI clipboard.
