\noindent
Above you can see our GUI. From the top left you can see 5 lines written, one of the blank.
\\'a Test' is marked and can be use to copy/paste or delete this section.
Ln 5-5 means marked are rows from 5 to 5, same for Col but column 1 to 7.
'Line breaks: LINUX' means that the current line break style used is LINUX ($\backslash$n). It also supports MSDOS ($\backslash$r$\backslash$n) and MAC ($\backslash$r).
\\Next to it you also have total line and total word count and to the right is the short-cut to exit the editor.
At the very bottom are buttons that you can press to use them. S\&R means search and replace.
\\All aspetcs of our GUI will be shown in this video \cite{demo}, as some of these things are impractical to show on a picture.
