Over all we have managed to build a really good editor backend that leverages our customized and well adapted data structure concepts. We are achieved all the goals we have set ourselves a the beginning of the project and full filled more software requirements then initially planed \ref{SwReq}. Whilst the front end is functionally good, the text structure back end enables to full fill all the points we listed in the introduction even with very good performance.
