\section{Lessons Learned}\label{sec:lessons}
% What did you learn during the project? Which skills did you acquire? What did you learn about
% yourself and your role in a software development team?
%GUI
For the GUI aspect we learned that cursor and internal position can very easily desync, it happened way too often and not even because of wide character support.
\\The other big part for the GUI group was also time mangagement, we were way too slow at the beginning and middle of the project and definitly caused the other group some headaches.
\\Next time we should definitly try to put alot more work into the beginning.
