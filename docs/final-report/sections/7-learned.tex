\section{Lessons Learned}\label{sec:lessons}
% What did you learn during the project? Which skills did you acquire? What did you learn about
% yourself and your role in a software development team?
%GUI
For the GUI aspect we learned that cursor and internal position can very easily de-synchronized, it happened way too often and not even because of wide character support.
\\The other big part for the GUI group was also time management, we were way too slow at the beginning and middle of the project and definitely caused the other group some headaches. Next time we should definitely try to put a lot more work into the beginning.
\medskip

Text structure wise we learn very much in this project, especially  what considerations go into the design of a text editor and what should be given special attention when handling UTF-8 encoded text. Last but not least we took great pleasure in discovering the low level optimization capabilities provided by C and the satisfaction of having code run accelerated and fast (compared to java).
