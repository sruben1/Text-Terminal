%GUI
We have most normal features a text editor should have like a cursor, mouse integration, deleting, line breaks etc.
We even have some more "esoteric" features like search/replace, copy/past and can even open multi GB files, so in terms of actual features we are pretty satisfied with the outcome.
\\But there are also some problems that could use some work, for example emojis are displayed as more than one character even though they are only one UTF-8 character, so they are cumbersom to use in the editor and can cause bugs.
\\Horizontal scrolling is also not working in the final build, it used to work at some point but stopped working somwhere down the line. Now when you reach the right end of the screen it just stops.
