I attest with my signature that I have completed this paper independently and without any assistance from third parties and that the information concerning the sources used in this paper is true and complete in every respect. All sources that have been quoted or paraphrased have been referenced accordingly.
Additionally, I affirm that any text passages written with the help of AI-supported technology are marked as such, including a reference to the AI-supported program used.
This paper may be checked for plagiarism and use of AI-supported technology using appropriate software. I understand that unethical conduct may lead to a grade of 1 or “fail” or to expulsion from the course of studies.
I have taken note of the fact that in the event of a justified suspicion of the unauthorized or undisclosed use of AI in written performance assessments, I am upon request obligated to cooperate in confirming or ruling out the suspicion, for example by attending an interview.
